A new song that began when I took on the [Open Source Musicians Podcast Tunestorm Chanllenge #15](https://archive.org/details/OSMP80) (that's a big name). The challenge was to create a song featuring [these two riffs](https://archive.org/details/RiffItFiles) proeminently. I started playing around with the riffs and slowly this massive song came to life amd I'm really proud of it!

The lyrics are a collage of several small verses I had, mostly about the ethical conumdrums of automated warfare. The different themes and riffs in the song try to represent these dillemas.

I rushed to release it because of the Tunestorm, It's still not ready, you can expect a new verse and a few more chorus runs in the end of the song. Super busy with non-music-making life right now, but I hope to finish it soon.

Bye!
