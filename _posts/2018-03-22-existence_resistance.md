Hey peeps,

Throughout 2017 I've been using a bunch of free software to record some demos for my band called Mortticia. At the beginning of this year I've slightly remixed them and we're releasing it as a small demo EP called "Existence / Resistance". I'd describe the genre as traditional 80s heavy metal with some more modern elements. If you're interested in this kind of music, please give it a listen and follow the band in your favorite social networks.

You can stream/download from several places, just follow the link here: <https://mortticia.rocks/music/>

I'm happy enough with the result but I know it's far from perfect so it hurts a little to release these tracks. I feel like I learned a lot and could do so much better, but alas, I also feel I need to release this and move on to the next steps and newer projects. Hope you like it!

Meanwhile I've been studying a lot about production and music in general, there's some nice courses on Coursera ([1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/vocal-production) and [2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/producing-music)) and doing a LOT of composing that I can't seem to transform into finished songs... but it seems to all be going somewhere. I'll continue onwards!
