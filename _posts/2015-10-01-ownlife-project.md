Hello everyone, I'm a Brazilian musician/programmer and this is just one more place on the Internet where I'll write about my music.

**Ownlife** is a name for a **progressive rock** band, BUT it's really just a side project where I put all the music I've composed by myself and try to make it really weird. Some things you should know about Ownlife:

  * The name comes from George Orwell's 1984 and it's awesome. [Go read the book](http://www.openculture.com/free_ebooks) if you haven't. {% sidenote 1 "Five minutes in and I'm telling you to go read a book, OMG so intellectual and EDGY!"%}
  * I mostly use Free/Libre open source software and the Linux operating system to make music. The motivation is a mix of idelogical with creative reasons.
  * Progressive Rock means: I like rock and heavy music, but also mellow stuff and will be mixing it with other styles of music. {% sidenote 2 '... and wrapping it all up into an unconventional time signature which sounds complicated but is actually really easy to play.'%}
  * I'd like to be able to perform these songs live, but I'd also like to go all out on the arrangements and layering. When presented with the choice I'll chose the latter.

So, if you're on board with all this you'll like to know that this is a kind of log of my activities regarding this band/project. Truth is I've been composing songs which fit the Ownlife "theme" for 5 years now and I've got so many pieces and fragments which I could develop into full songs, but just didn't. Sometimes I forget that I got caught up into my routine, into my job, into other interesting projects and days will pass without a creative moment, but these melodies and stories always come back to me. So let's get them out.

Have you read it until this point? Here's a small fragment of something I call **Summer Comes After** which is utterly incomplete and needs more work.
