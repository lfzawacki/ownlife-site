I'm back home after 2 months abroad in Toronto/Canada with my girlfriend. During this time I didn't do a lot of recording but worked on
making [Musical Artifacts](https://musical-artifacts.com/) better and interacting with the Linux Audio Community.

I also did a bit of composing, learned to use some new software, started studying jazz guitar and stocked up sounds and soundfonts. While in Canada I bought an awesome used guitar from a cool shop filled with vintage stuff. Here's a picture:

I've used a Stratocaster for so long and really love the clean and lead tones I get from it, but I really wanted something with a Humbucker.
This Yamaha has P9 pickups which are a kind of compromise between single coils and humbuckers and it sounds really good on the styles that I play. It also plays like a drums, really fun to just jam around for hours.

I'll leave you with 2 little recordings I made while I was away. The first is something I felt inspired to write with some electronic sounds from this
amazing soundfont called [Vintage Dreams](https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/248):

The second is a kind of arrangement of the song [Gravemakers and Gunslingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLPF1ohyNxA) of the band Coheed and Cambria, but with instruments from the Megaman X1 and X2 games. The guitars and drums were written originally in a Guitar Pro tab by 'K. Pratt', but I'm rewriting and arranging the bass, vocals and backing vocals by ear so that's why it's not finished yet. This concept is equal parts ridiculous and fun so I'll probably try more of it in the future:
