Hey!

I've finished tracking all the electric and acoustic guitars on 'Summer Comes After' but I'm not happy with the mix I'm getting. In few days I might have something to show and I'll probably start recording the vocals.

I've bought a new audio interface to record guitar sounds and I'm still waiting for it to come in the mail so I've been using most of my free time NOT recording music. Mostly I've been working on my free software projects, and singing and playing random songs.

In the meantime, I thought I might post this little song here:

<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/218503217%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-1wb8I&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

My pitch is off in some parts so this is a 'blog exclusive' track just for the more dedicated fans :)

Bye!
